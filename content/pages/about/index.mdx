Nilesh Kumar - currently working as a Security Analyst at Diebold Nixdorf by day, and a hacker always... I hack technology, society & life around to understand how everythings works, and integrate the findings to improve quality of living. I have also held free workshops and paid trainings to teach others about security and hacking. I have recently started to post some videos about hacking and my travels on YouTube. I also love playing video games like Watchdogs, GTA V, Assassin's Creed, Call of Duty Mobile, and Borderlands.
