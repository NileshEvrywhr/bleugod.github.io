followed [this video](https://youtu.be/xftEuVQ7kY0) and created the lab in an old laptop with VMs first.

then did it in cloud environment with azure. i don't remember which blog i followed but, here's [one](https://kamran-bilgrami.medium.com/ethical-hacking-lessons-building-free-active-directory-lab-in-azure-6c67a7eddd7f) that explain things well. 

i won't show you the final product bcoz, well i did it a long while ago(2019) - that free azure account i used(yeah, poor young Nilesh) is probably disabled - i might pay to restart it later to run more experiments - not promising anything
