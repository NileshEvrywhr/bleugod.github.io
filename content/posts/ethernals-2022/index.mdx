i collected a bunch of random strangers off the internet(actually they were college and work friends). well technically, i haven't been keeping in touch with them for the longest time, and yes none of them live closeby so, yeah they reallly are strangers on the internet. 

this is the project(kind of): https://github.com/NileshEvrywhr/etherventure

this is our submission on ethernals website: https://devfolio.co/submissions/smart-contracts-events-listener-e7ca
