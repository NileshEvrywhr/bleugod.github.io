- you dont have to re-invent the wheel and travel somewhere new or do something completely off the charts - always remember you are doing it for yourself - YOU choose what you want to do with your time, not dictated by algorithms of instagram, or other people wants

- just note down evrything from names of places and activities other people are doing - no matter how luxurious, or pricey they look - no hesitations - its like copying from others in exam - jo mil rha, jaha se mil rha h, chaap lo - who knows teacher ko kya pasand aaye aur wo kiske number de de - here, the teacher is Future You who is now at the destination and is looking for things to do - and remember, you don't HAVE to do evrything on the list - you just want to have options, because that mindset is key - find out what other people are do and how they do it, and how you want to do it - since this is your first time travelling, IMITATION IS THE GAME. 

- stop waiting - just start - you don't have to optimize costs and time right now - you just need travel once - a full cycle - from plan to action - optimization comes later when you sit and retrospect about where you can improve - but you HAVE to go do it once - when you do it once and like it, and you will want to do it again, you will have plenty of time and attention to focus on optimizing 

- gather all the information you can from other people's travel stories and then try to recreate what they did - like an OSINT Investigator gathering intel on their target(finally! the hacker me awakens) - or you know, act like it a normal human being and ask them - where they stayed, what they did, how much did it cost - this will also help you realize it's not crazy/scary/difficult 

- when you're young, we can take lots of small risks, bcoz we have time to learn & recover from them - even if you lose some money on the first trip, you can make more later. if you get physically hurt, you have time to heal from it, try again better so you don't have to go through the same bad experiences again.

- your brain is quite good at detecting threats. you see, in the event of a physical threat, the amygdala in your brain can jump to the fight-or-flight response, but the front lobes process the information you're receiving to help you determine if the danger is real. coming back through a forest, in heavy rainfall, with leeches stuck to your feet is NOT a threat - okay maybe the first time it is. it'll be an experience, i promise

- you can make the decision but if there's greater risk than you want to handle, you'll not do it. but smaller risk help you learn, and you shouldn't limit yourself to the comfort zone when you want to learn and grow as a human being

- everything i've written here has a pattern - stability - we are stabilizing money, time, places which will inturn help stabilize our minds from all the things we need to pay attention to at any given moment. 

- remove this mental block of how things will turn out - take the first step and universe will help - and wouldnt you want all the help we can get from the universe?!

<!-- relying too much on tech? - privacy issues? - problem 1 hackers 2 targeted ads  -->

- remember you are doing this bcoz you are a free human - not bcoz you saw over-glamorized travel reels on instagram(well do set specific watch times, but also act by planning and then actually travelling instead of just watch paralysis)
