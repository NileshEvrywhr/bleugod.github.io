10:00 AM IST / 6,900 FEET OVER HIMACHAL PRADESH

(intro from the hotel room when i reach himachal pradesh)

Having travelled solo to the hills for the first time ever just because I wanted to, I think I can provide some value to the people who have the means to travel but don't know how to. These pointers on how to best go about planning your destination travel, or possible world tour are tried and tested by me, a 26yo who last year was in Hyderabad, for an 8 and 1/2 month silent retreat inside a 3BHK apartment. 

the following will be steps you can take right now, to convert your travel thoughts to actual bookings and eventual reality - the reason we don't plan our travels to completion - everything will be actionable advice and the recurring theme you'll notice is that we're trying to ground our thoughts for each aspect of travel

first and foremost, and i cannot stress this enough - you NEED to apply your brains - nothing is going to happen on its own - but also you don't have to do everything - it's like the universe doesn't conspire against you, but it doesn't go out of its way to line up all the pins either - conditions are never perfect - so if it's important to you and you want to do it "eventually", just do it and correct along the way. 

whenever you hear about a new place in a movie, TV or a reel(oh how the times have changed!) -

<!-- google calendar research time event, with funny title -->

1. set a calendar event to research - even 30 minutes are enough - yes we want to schedule time for this and not just doomscroll instagram for over glamourized travel reels

2. search on google maps and look at where places actually are on a map - you will get to know a fact - and it won't change. ever. - helps in realizing your plan

3. check distances - you see all these stories from evryone around the world - wondering ek jagah staty kar itna sb kaise ghumega - again, check distances on maps - most the places are in clusters - you choose a stay and there are 10000 more within spitting distances - food places - temples - beaches - markets - it is normal place where people live 

4. watch the routes - maybe even visualize yourself walking through them - people doing the usual things - this is psychological - and you will feel it's easier to plan - and not a pahad to scale - coz that's called trekking - and woh bhi itne saare h aas paas

5. check the costs - time, monaayyyy - you don't have to book right away - but checking prices around the dates - help stabilizes how much money you will need - flights, buses, hostels, hotels, room sb ka ka price kitna 

6. calculate cost of living - actually before this you should figure out how much is your monthly expenses - track your spends to get an idea - so you can get a sense of living in the place you're travelling to - but in general too - track your spends, and budget is a good habit - and helps in the long run with everything

7. call the accompanying contacts from the hotels. hostels and talk to them - tell them a tntative date - and disucs charges, options, just for 30 minutes - you will feel things are not as difficult as our minds make it.

8. train/bus/flight bookigs me use as much filters as you can - to avoid the paradox of choice - less options are more easier to choose from - apply filters for fixed items - the exact pickupdrop point/ the departure /arrival time period, evening morening arrival departure - sort for less duration or prices - he process here is all about narrowing things down. Eliminating choices. Giving yourself fewer options.

9. how to figure out routes for bus booking/planning locations to visit? - use google maps ka add destination feature - add a bunch of locations you'd want to visit - it shows the distance and time from one to another - reorder and create a route - note the total travel time and distacne covered for a day,  you want to minimize it so you spend more time iexploring places and not in cabs and buses and transport - some might find it a bit too much - but i absolutely love doing this - and it does help a lot when you're actually visiting, it's one less thing you have to worry about - itna plannig fot his isnt much - an alternative is to ask locals zindabad - but just do it once and see for yourself

### the psychology of travel

you dont have to reinvent the wheel and travel somewhere new or do something completely off grid - always remember you are doing it for yourself - YOU choose what you want from the list you crete

just note down evrything from names and activities that other people are doing - no matter how luxurious, or pricey they look - no restriction - its like copying from others in exam - jo mil rha, jaha se mil rha h chaap lo - you don't know teacher to kya pasand aaye aur wo kiske number de de 

remember you don't HAVE to do evrything on the list - you just have to fugure out what people do and how they do it - and how you want to do it

IMITATE for the first time - stop waiting - just start - you don't have to optimize costs and time right now - you just need travel once - a full cycle - plan to action - optimization will automatically come later when you sit and think in retrospect about what you can improve - but you HAVE to go do it once - (skin in the game concepts)?

gather all the info you can from other people's travel stories and then try to recreate what they did - like doing digital forensics investigator(finally, the hacker in me is awake ~ KC Roasters coffee joke here) - or you know, do it a regular human being and ask them - where they stayed what they did - this will also help you realize it's not that scary/crazy difficult 

when we're young, we shouldn't essentially lots of small risks, bcoz we have time to learn from them, and correct them, even if you lose some money on the first trip, you can make more later. if you get physically hurt, you have time to recover, try again better so you don't get hurt again. agar Jaan ka khatra nahi h, and obvious you will do everything in your power to protect yourself, and you can judge if there's greater risk than you want to handle, you'll not do it. but smaller risk help you learn, and shouldn't limit yourself to the comfort zone if you want to learn and grow as a human being

everythigs i wirte here has a pattern - stability - we are stabilizing money, time, place(more realms?) which will inturn stabilize our minds from all the things we need to plan which are hawe me right now. 

remove this mental block of how things will turn out - we take the first step and universe will help - and woudnt we want all the help we can get from the universe?!

### 
relying too much on tech? - privacy issues? - problem 1 hackers 2 targeted ads 

remember we are doing this coz we free humans - not bcoz we saw over-glamorized travel reels on instagram(well you can watch, but do act by planning and then actually travelling instead of just watch paralysis)

when you know wher to go, what to do, how much it will cost, you have the money, time, all the resources - you will realize this was never stopiing you from actually getting out of the house and travelling - it wasn't these material resources - but that's for another tweet/article/blog
