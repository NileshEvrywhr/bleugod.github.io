10:00 AM IST / 6,900 FEET OVER HIMACHAL PRADESH

(intro from the hotel room when i reach himachal pradesh)

<!-- 4 years, ## cities -->
Having travelled solo to the hills for the first time ever just because I wanted to, I want to provide some value to the people who have the means to travel but don't know how to. These pointers on how to best go about planning your destination travel, or possible world tour are tried and tested by me, a 26yo who spent most of last year in Hyderabad, practicing self-imposed silent retreat inside a 3BHK apartment.

the following will be steps you can take right now, to convert your travel thoughts to actual bookings and eventual reality - the reason we don't plan our travels to completion - everything will be actionable advice and the recurring theme you'll notice is that we're trying to ground our thoughts for each aspect of travel

first and foremost, and i cannot stress this enough - you NEED to apply your brains - nothing is going to happen on its own - but also you don't have to do everything - it's like the universe doesn't conspire against you, but it doesn't go out of its way to line up all the pins either - conditions are never perfect - so if it's important to you and you want to do it "eventually", just do it and correct course along the way. 

whenever you hear about a new place in a movie, TV or a reel(oh how the times have changed!) -

<!-- google calendar research time event, with funny title -->

1. **set a calendar event to research** - Even 30 minutes are sufficient(snowballing will take care of the rest) - yes we want to schedule time for this so we don't just end up doomscrolling instagram the whole time, consuming over glamourized travel reels

2. search on Maps and **look at where places actually are on a map** - you will get to know how far it is, and available modes of transport to get there - and it won't change. ever - congratulations! you are now 1 fact closer towards realizing your plan

3. **check distances** - you see all these stories from everyone around the world - wondering how people visit so many places in such short times - again, check distances on maps - most tourist places actually exist in clusters - wherever you choose to stay, there are 10000 places within spitting distances - food, temples, treks, beaches, markets, libraries or whatever you fancy - it is the usual environment where people live & breathe - although booking away from popular spots helps save you money, this is not that kind of article

4. **watch the routes** - maybe even visualize yourself walking on the streets, through the markets, trekking in the forests - people getting on with their daily routine - this is purely psychological - and you will feel it's easier to plan - not as difficult as "scaling a mountain", no pun intented. 

5. **check the costs** - Time, Money, Attention - you don't have to book right away - but checking prices around some dates - help us ground ourselves with an estimate of the money we'll need - the duration of travels - flights, buses, trains. the costs of stay in hotels or hostel rooms. which activities you absolutely want to participate in, and which you can ignore. 

6. **calculate money cost of living** - before you do this, you must figure out what your average monthly expenses are - start to track your spends to get an idea(I reccommend [ETMoney's Spends Tracker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smartspends) or [GoodBudget](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dayspringtech.envelopes)) - so you can get a sense of cost of living in the place you're travelling to. but in general too - tracking your spends, and budgeting is a good habit - and helps in the long run with everything else.

7. **call the accompanying contacts** from the accomodations and talk to them - tell them a tentative date - and discuss costs & options, just for research purposes - hearing from people actually living there and telling you insider knowledge, you will realize it's not as difficult as our minds make it.

8. when choosing train/bus/flight bookings, **use as many filters as you can** - to avoid the paradox of choice(AKA choice paralysis)- less options are more easier to choose from - apply filters for things you can easily decide on - the pickup/drop point, departure/arrival time, evenings/mornings arrival/departure - sort for less duration or prices - this is to narrow things down and remove noise. Eliminating choices. Giving yourself fewer options.

<!-- filters image redbus -->
9. **how to figure out routes for bus booking/planning locations to visit?** - use Google Maps's "Add Destination" feature - add a bunch of locations you want to visit - it shows the distance and time from one to another - reorder and create a route that works for you - i like to minimize the total time i spend sitting in transport vehicles so i have more time to explore the place, not the insides of cabs and bus - (although this can be avoided if you're travelling in a group, because you don't want to be the person who optimizes friendly hangout time, that is if you do not want to thrown out of the moving bus) - i absolutely love minimizing travel time by deciding on a skeletal route - and it does help a lot when you travel, it's one less thing you have to worry about. 

not that everything will ever go according to the plan, but we have to plan for the plan not going according to the plan(it's from a book i don't remember right now) - and whenever you do decide to wing it - being vocal with locals is still works.

### the psychology of travel

phrases, quotes, writings taken from various sources mixed with my own ramblings and applied in context of traveling -

you dont have to reinvent the wheel and travel somewhere new or do something completely off the charts - always remember you are doing it for yourself - YOU choose what you want to do with you time, no instagram algorithm, or other people wants

just note down evrything from names of places and activities other people are doing - no matter how luxurious, or pricey they look - no restrictions - its like copying from others in exam - jo mil rha, jaha se mil rha h chaap lo - who knows teacher ko kya pasand aaye aur wo kiske number de de - and remember you don't HAVE to do evrything on the list - we just have to figure out what other people do and how they do it - and how you want to do it - IMITATION IS THE GAME. 

stop waiting - just start - you don't have to optimize costs and time right now - you just need travel once - a full cycle - plan to action - optimization will automatically come later when you sit and think in retrospect about what you can improve - but you HAVE to go do it once - (skin in the game concepts)?

gather all the info you can from other people's travel stories and then try to recreate what they did - like doing digital forensics investigator(finally, the hacker in me awakens, no thanks to you [â‚¹650 KC Roasters' The Purple Project](https://kcroasters.com/) - or you know, behave it a regular human being and ask them - where they stayed what they did - this will also help you realize it's not that scary/crazy difficult 

when we're young, we must take lots of small risks, bcoz we have time to correct them, learn & recover from them, even if you lose some money on the first trip, you can make more later. if you get physically hurt, you have time to recover, try again better so you don't get hurt again. your brain is quite good at detecting threats, amygdala. you see, in the event of a physical threat, the amygdala can jump to the fight-or-flight response, but the front lobes process the information you're receiving to help you determine if the danger is real. you wandering forests of Mahabaleshwar is NOT a threat.

agar Jaan ka khatra nahi h, and obvious you will do everything in your power to protect yourself, and you can judge if there's greater risk than you want to handle, you'll not do it. but smaller risk help you learn, and shouldn't limit yourself to the comfort zone if you want to learn and grow as a human being

everythigs i wirte here has a pattern - stability - we are stabilizing money, time, place(more realms?) which will inturn stabilize our minds from all the things we need to plan which are hawe me right now. 

remove this mental block of how things will turn out - we take the first step and universe will help - and woudnt we want all the help we can get from the universe?! 

1 2 3 dot degrees of freedom analogy

relying too much on tech? - privacy issues? - problem 1 hackers 2 targeted ads 

remember we are doing this coz we free humans - not bcoz we saw over-glamorized travel reels on instagram(well you can watch, but do act by planning and then actually travelling instead of just watch paralysis)
