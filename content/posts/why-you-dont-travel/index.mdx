i'm writing this from the  room  in upper dharamkot, himachal pradesh. (4-hour workweek type opening)

having travelled solo for the first time without any external reasons than just wanting to bcoz i can - i have not right to give pointers on how to best go about doing so, since i'm only 26 and this is my first time solo travelling?, having said that still going the write what i want to(more edits needed ####)

hawe me zyada sochne ka nai - what you need to do is convert your thoughts to reality - organize your thoughts - and find actionable items

the universe doesn't conspire against you, but it doesn't go out of its way to line up all the pins either. conditions are never perfect.

if it's important to you and you want to do it "eventually", just do it and correct along the way.

and i cannot stress this enough - you HAVE to apply your brains - apne aap nahi hoega kuch bhi - people already know this - so i shouldn't put this in the final draft maybe - 

when you hear about a new place - do this

there's no easy way to say this - but just get up and do it - research

set aside a calendar event (just 2 hours is enough) to research - yes we want to schedule time for this so we don't end doomscroling instagram for eternity

google maps kholo and look at where places actually are - you will get to know a fact - and it won't change. ever. - helps in realizing your plan

check distances - you see all these stories from evryone around the world - wondering ek jagah staty kar itna sb kaise ghumega - again check distances on maps - most the places are in clusters - you choose a stay and there are 10000 more within spitting distances - food places - temples - beaches - markets - it is normal place where people live 

call the accompanying contacts from the hotels. hostels and talk to them - tell them a tntative date - and disucs charges, options, just for 30 minutes - you will feel things are not as difficult as our minds make it.

watch the routes - maybe even visualize yourself walking through them - people doing the usual things - this is psychological - and you will feel it's easier to plan - and not a pahad to scale - coz that's called trekking - and woh bhi itne saare h aas paas

check the prices - costs, time, monaayyyy - you don't have to book right away - but checking prices around the dates - help stabilizes how much money you will need - flights, buses, hostels, hotels, room sb ka ka price kitna 

calculate cost of living - actually before this you should figure out how much is your monthly expenses - track your spends to get an idea - so you can get a sense of living in the place you're travelling to - but in general too - track your spends, and budget is a good habit - and helps in the long run with everything

you dont have to reinvent the wheel and travel somewhere new or do something completely off grid - always remember you are doing it for yourself - YOU choose what you want from the list you crete

just note down evrything from names and activities that other people are doing - no matter how luxurious, or pricey they look - no restriction - its like copying from others in exam - jo mil rha, jaha se mil rha h chaap lo - you don't know teacher to kya pasand aaye aur wo kiske number de de 

remember you don't HAVE to do evrything on the list - you just have to fugure out what people do and how they do it - and how you want to do it 

IMITATE for the first time - stop waiting - just start - you don't have to optimize costs and time - you only need to do it once - a full cycle - end to end - optimization will automatically come later when you sit and think in retrospect about what you can improve - but you HAVE to it once atleast 

gather all the info you can from other people's travel stories and then try to recreate what they did - like doing digital forensics investigator(finally, the hacker in me is awake, thanks coffee man! ~ coffee joke here) - where they stayed what they did - this will also help you realize it's not that scary/crazy difficult 

when we're young, we shouldn't essentially lots of small risks, bcoz we have time to learn from them, and correct them, even if you lose some money on the first trip, you can make more later. if you get physically hurt, you have time to recover, try again better so you don't get hurt again. agar Jaan ka khatra nahi h, and obvious you will do everything in your power to protect yourself, and you can judge if there's greater risk than you want to handle, you'll not do it. but smaller risk help you learn, and shouldn't limit yourself to the comfort zone if you want to learn and grow as a human being

everythigs i wirte here has a pattern - stability - we are stabilizing money, time, place(more realms) which will inturn stabilize our minds from all the things we need to plan which are hawe me right now. 

remove this mental block of how things will turn out - we take the first step and universe will help - and woudnt we want all the help we can get from the universe?! 

remember we are doing this coz we free humans - not bcoz we saw over-glamorized travel reels on instagram(well you can watch, but do act by planning and then actually travelling instead of just watch paralysis)

when you know wher to go, what to do, how much it will cost, you have the money, time, all the resources - you will realize this was never stopiing you from actually getting out of the house and travelling - it wasn't these material resources - but that's for another tweet/article/blog 

how to figure out routes for bus booking/planning locations to visit? - use google maps ka add destination feature - add a bunch of locations you'd want to visit - it shows the distance and time from one to another - reorder and create a route - note the total travel time and distacne covered for a day,  you want to minimize it so you spend more time iexploring places and not in cabs and buses and transport - some might find it a bit too much - but i absolutely love doing this - and it does help a lot when you're actually visiting, it's one less thing you have to worry about - itna plannig fot his isnt much - an alternative is to ask locals zindabad - but just do it once and see for yourself

1 2 3 dot degrees of freedom in space analogy

relying too much on tech? - privacy issues? - problem 1 hackers 2 targeted ads

train/bus/flight bookigs me use as much filters as you can - to avoid the paradox of choice - less options you see more easier to choose from - apply filters for the fixed items - the exact pickupdrop point/ the departure /arrival time period, evening morening arival departure - sort for less duration or prices - he process here is all about narrowing things down. Eliminating choices. Giving yourself fewer options.

maybe what you need is to learn to let go of her fear of things not working out? bcoz intuitively you knows best. just take a leap of faith. if it doesn't work out, atleast you tried. 

- fail hue to kya? gir gye to kya? we learn from our mistakes and do things differently next time. experiment. 

- what's there to lose? 1 month and some money? but aren't we losing our minds a little everyday, overthinking and doing same old cycle of eat sleep work repeat? ittu si he to life h ü§åüèº do we want to regret in our last days thinking back to this day. i don't want to do that. do you?
