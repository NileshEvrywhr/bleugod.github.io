# Hi.

I'm Nilesh - currently learning web3, smart contracts security, crytpo, DAOs, & NFTs. I also livestream during weekdays(mostly) on YouTube and Twitch about learning & hacking all sorts of technology. This week's about [playing flAWS.cloud and learning to hack the websites hosted on AWS](https://youtu.be/2fEo0XsrEFw). Watch how misconfiguration in the largest cloud infrastructure lead to your favorite applications getting hacked.
