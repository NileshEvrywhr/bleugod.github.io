# Hi.

I'm Nilesh - currently learning web3 & smart contracts security, android hacking 101, long term travelling & guilt-free naps mid-day. I livestream during weekdays(mostly) on YouTube and Twitch about learning & hacking all sorts of technology. This week's about [playing flAWS.cloud and learning to hack the websites hosted on AWS](https://youtu.be/2fEo0XsrEFw). how misconfiguration in the largest cloud infrastructure lead to your favorite applications getting hacked.
