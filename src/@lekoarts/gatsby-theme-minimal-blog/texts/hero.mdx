# Hi.

I'm Nilesh - currently learning web3 & smart contract security - android hacking 101 - long term travelling & guilt-free mid-day naps. I livestream during weekdays(mostly) on YouTube OR Twitch about learning & hacking all sorts of technology. This week is about [hacking BlackRock](https://youtu.be/2fEo0XsrEFw). the company that owns the world.
